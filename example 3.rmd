## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
cars
nrow(cars)
cars$speed
cars$dist
mylm<-lm(cars$dist~cars$speed)
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist, xlab = "speed", ylab = "distance", main = "Cars speed vs distance", pch=19)
abline(mylm,col="red", lwd=2, lty=2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
